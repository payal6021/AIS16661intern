Task 1: DECLARATION OF RULES-studied rules of declation of variables,OPERATORS-In operators studied about ASSIGNMENT RULES,Arithmatic operators,comparision operators,logical operators,Identity Erors,Membership operators.
Task 1 :TYPES OF DATA STRUCTURES:- Studied various data types 
 1. Numeric data types -I) Integer  II) complex  III)  float
 2.   2. Non numeric data set  - I) String
 3. 3. Sequential data set   -  I) List  II)  Tuple   III)set  IV) Dictionary
    4. We use integer data type to represent whole numbers,We use float data type to represent floating numbers(Decimal numbers)        complex data structure -It is a combination of real and Imaginary number,basically it is used in scientific calculations.        Non Numeric Data Type - String takes Alphabets. Sequential  data types : List -List stores in [] square brackets,It is mutable(Changable)  Tuple :- Touple is a readable version of list,It is unmutable (unchanged),creation of empty tuple in () brackets.set-set stores in {} curly brackets.Dictionary-If we want to represent a group of object as key-value paires then we should go for dictionary.It is stored in {} curly brackets **syntax**={key:'value',key:'value'}.
    
Task 2 : studied about In-Build function like If__ , If__else , If__ elif__ else , For loop and while loop.
If__statement  :that allows you to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true. 
If__ else__statement :Provides an alternative execution path if the if condition is false
If__elif__statement  : that allows you to add additional conditions if the previous conditions are false.
for__loop__statement  : is a control flow statement that allows you to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each item in that sequence.
While__loop : The while loop in Python repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is True called Infinite loop.
